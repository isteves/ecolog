## Defining categories

I reviewed the list of most-common words in the ecolog subject headers, and came up with a classification system for the different types of posts:

- positions
    - jobs
    - internships
    - volunteer
    - reu
    - msc
    - phd
    - postdoc
    - faculty
- events
- grants/scholarships
